            <h2>Rapid Logging</h2>
            <p class="lead">At the heart of the journaling and task management applications of Bullet Journaling is a method I call “Rapid Logging”. Rapid Logging allows you to quickly capture and parse the various different kinds of data we’re trying to digest daily. This technique provides insights that can help you identify what’s important and weed out the things that aren’t. Figuring that out will help focus your time and energy much more effectively. It’s the difference between being busy and being productive.</p>

            <a href="#entries" class="btn_next">On to topics</a>
          </div>


          <div id="entries" class="subsection span8">
            <h2>Topics + Entries</h2>

            <p>In the Bullet Journal, anything you put into your book is referred to as an “entry”. To add an entry, turn to your first empty pair of facing blank pages or spread. On the top left page give your spread a brief descriptive title or topic. If a page is just for general entries, place the days date as the topic. If a topic is specific however, take a second and give some thought to naming it. Your topic can help you clarify and focus the content you’re about to enter. Ask yourself, “What would best describe what I’m about to enter?” </p>

            <p>If you feel that this topic will be complex or spread out over a long time, then add a subtopics to clarify what part of a project this collection is referring to. In this case the subtopics are “-----”</p>

            <p>Feel free to keep the following spread or two empty, but don’t worry about hoarding pages because it’s hard to tell how many spreads you’ll need for a given topic. Topics are often non-consecutive, so be sure to always add them to the index after you’ve created them. </p>

          <div id='bullets' class="subsection span8">
            <h2>Bullets</h2>
            <p>Sketches and drawing notwithstanding, the biggest problem with note-taking and traditional journaling is that it takes time. The more complex the entry, the more effort you have to expend. The more effort you expend the more of a chore writing things down becomes. To assist with this, <a href="#rapidLogging">Rapid Logging</a> relies heavily on the use of short form-notation or bullets. Bullets allow you to quickly create entries by drastically reducing complexity. To to make things even easier, the Bullet Journal provides three bullet types to categorize text entries: <a href="#tasks">Tasks</a>, Notes, and Events.  </p>

            <a href="#tasks" class="btn_next">Continue to tasks</a>
          </div>

          <div id='tasks' class="subsection span8">
            <h2>Tasks</h2>
            <p> Tasks are represented by the empty checkboxes and include any kind of actionable items like “do laundry” or “read Snow Crash”. Some tasks require multiple steps to complete. These steps or sub-tasks can be listed by simply indenting the check boxes underneath the original or master task. Master tasks can only be marked as complete once all the sub-tasks have been completed or marked as irrelevant. </p>
            <a href="#notes" class="btn_next">Continue to notes</a>
          </div>

          <div id='notes' class="subsection span8">
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>Notes are represented with the dot bullet. Notes include: ideas, thoughts, observations, and non-actionable notes. Basically anything you just want to jot down that is either not immediately actionable or has no greater context at the time of entry. </p>
            <a href="#events" class="btn_next">Continue to events</a>
          </div>


          <div id='events' class="subsection span8">
            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>Events are represented by an empty circle. This category can be tricky as it’s the most subjective - not to mention the most charged. Most traditional journaling fails because it either takes too much time, effort, or just taxes you emotionally. <a href="#rapidLogging">Rapid Logging</a> addresses this issue by keeping event entries, no matter how personal, as objective and brief as possible. For example, movie night, should have no more or less weight than a good friend moving far away. </p>

            <p>Keep in mind, that bullets are mainly intended for reference. Once you’ve logged the event, feel free to write at length about it on the next available page. Just be sure to mark your topic in your index. A major part of the bullet journal is that you can use it however you want, but following the simple guidelines will help you to make sense of it all. </p>

            <a href="#signifiers" class="btn_next">Continue to signifiers</a>
          </div>

          <div id='signifiers' class="subsection span8">
            <h2>Signifiers</h2>
            <p>Signifiers are additional marks that give your entries additional context.</p>

            <h3>Important</h3>
            <p>Represented by a star, is used to give a bullet, well, priority. It goes to the left of a bullet so that you quickly scan your pages and find entries that are most important.</p>

            <h3>Explore </h3>
            <p>The explore signifier, represented by an eye, is used when there is something that you want to look up. Let’s say you take a note that requires some research, use the explore signifier to remind you to look it up later. </p>


             <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>The inspiration signifire is most commonly paired with a note and is represented by a exclamation point. There’s nothing worse than having misplaced a note containg this great idea that you just can’t remember. Now just place “!” in front that note so can quickly reference it later, or add it to “Ideas” collection. </p>


            <h3>Other</h3>

            <p>The migrated signifier, represented by a right arrow,  is placed inside of uncompleted <a href="#tasks">Tasks</a> that you’ve migrated to another section in your Bullet Journal. </p>

            <p>When a task has become irrlevant, it is signified by striking throught that task. A lot of these are used if somthing has missed a date, or if a project is abandoned. </p>

          <div id='pagenumbers' class="subsection span8">

            <h2>Page Numbers</h2>
            
            <p>Always number your pages! Some recurring entries and collections just won’t be consecutive, so it’s very important to always write down the page numbers in the bottom corners of each spread so you can add them to your index. </p>

            <a href="#index" class="btn_next">Continue to Indexing</a>
          </div>

            <h2>Index</h2>
            <div>    
              <p>Indexing your content provides you the flexibility to organically fill your Bullet Journal while still being able to quickly find what you’re looking for.  It’s a combination of a traditional index page, and an appendix, but instead of chapters, it will list your topics. </p>

              <p>The index should be created on the first blank page of your Bullet Journal.</p>

              <p>As you start filling your Bullet Journal, simply add your topics and their page numbers to the index. Topics that span a series of pages are indexed like this 5-10. Some topics however are recurring and can span multiple pages, spread out in your Bullet Journal. These topics can be indexed like this: Topic Name: 5-10, 23, 34-39 etc. If you used sub-topics, they will come in handy here: </p>

            </div>
            <p> To create your first calendar, find the next blank spread. The left page will be for events, and the right will be for your <a href="#tasks">Tasks</a>. First, title your page with the current month. Now list all the days of that month down the left margin. Be sure to leave some room between the side of the page and the number as we need room for additional signifiers. If you like, you can also add the first character of the weekdays. </p>
            




            <p>Enter any dates like birthdays or appointments the are unlikely to change. Your entries here should be as short as possible as this page is designed for quick referencing only. Schedule all tentative items in pencil. </p>

            <p>The task page is simply a list of task bullets.  Again, leave some room in the margin for the additional signifiers. List everything that you want to get done, even if you’re not planning to get it done that month. When you’re done listing tasks, review your list and see what items are most important. Add stars next to those items. </p>

            <p>Now you have an overview of the things you need to get done AND the time you have available to do it in. Of course you can schedule <a href="#tasks">Tasks</a> here if you like, but the object here is to contextualize your tasks in terms of the time you have. Again, I highly recommend scheduling <a href="#tasks">Tasks</a> in pencil because plans change.</p>

            <h2>Daily Calendar</h2>
            <p>Now lets turn the the page and layout your weekly spread. It helps to leave a blank spread right after your monthly Calendar even if you not ready to user your weekly spread yet. I’ve rarely needed more than three weekly spreads after a month spread, but you will find what works best for you. </p>

            <p>In your weekly spread, you simply write down the days date and begin bulleting. Ideally you will have your bullet journal with all the time, and can write down these items in real time, but if not, try to get into the practice of sitting down with your bullet journal before you go to sleep and reflect on the day. I feel it’s comforting and prepares you for the next morning.  </p>

      <div id='migration' class="subsection span12">
        <h2>Migration</h2>
        <p>Migrating content is a cornerstone of bullet journaling. Once you hit your next month, look through all the pages until you get to the previous month spread. Chances are, you will have some <a href="#<a href="#tasks">Tasks</a>">Tasks</a> left unchecked. Look through them and assess whether or not you did indeed complete those items, or if that task has become irrelevant. If an open task is complete, check it off. If it’s become irrelevant the strike out the whole line. If the task however is still something you need to take care of, then add it to your new monthly calendar calendars task page on the right.  </p>

        <p>The goal here is not to collect as many <a href="#tasks">Tasks</a> as possible, but rather to be mindful of what you need to do and to filter out items that just aren’t that important. It’s the difference between being busy and being productive.  </p>

    <h2>Collections</h2>
    <p>When you start using your Bullet Journal regularly, you’ll notice some or your bullets have a common theme, or are all directly related to one another. Once you have enough of them, it’s time to create a collection. To do this, simply turn to your next blank spread, and give your collection a topic. Find all the bullets that are relevant to that topic, mark them as migrated and add them to your new collection. Once you’re done be sure to add this new topic to your index so you can quickly refer to it later. </p>

    <p>Collections, like any other topic, can grow overtime and are a simple way to organize related  bullets. I find the best time to update your collections is at the beginning of the month when you create your monthly calendar. </p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <h3>Book Type:</h3> 

    <p>I prefer using a square moleskine notebook as the grid lends itself perfectly for what I do. This is by no means a prerequisite. Additionally, I like the accessories that are built into most moleskines like the book mark and the pocket in the back where I can quickly throw random scrap until I can deal with it it later. The two main things to keep in mind are size and quality. If it’s too big you’ll never take it with you. If it’s too small it will be impractical. Also get something that doesn’t fall apart. I love that I can look back at years worth of my Bullet Journals. The trick is that they need to last that long... </p>

    <h3>Identification and security:</h3>

    <p>Even though a lot of Bullet Journals can be intensely personal, I highly recommend adding a very visible note in the front of the book for people to contact you should you lose it. Leaving your first name and your phone number only should do the trick. Cash rewards are a great incentive, but so are personalized messages. My Bullet Journal fell out of my bag on a train to New York during rush hour, and it was returned to me. </p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class'lead'>My name is Ryder Carroll, I’m a Art Director and Interaction Designer living in Brooklyn NY. I’ve developed this system through trial and error over many years and hope to keep evolving it as I stumble across better patterns. I hope that you take the ideas presented here and apply/adapt them to work for you.</p>

    <p class'lead'>This website is my little thank you to the far more gifted and generous people who’ve helped and inspired me over the years by making their learnings, talents, and insights freely available. The Bullet Journal system has helped me tremendously over the years, and I hope in some small way it will be helpful to you.
